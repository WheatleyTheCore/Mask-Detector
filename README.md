# Mask-Detector
A mask detector built as a final project for AP Computer Science A.

## Project Requirements
- use variables
- use methods
- at least three classes 
- need to access each class/method within a class
- needs to run

## Notes
The structure of this project is kinda weird, but that is only becuase it needs to meet the above requirements.

Each file in the include directory is a class. The main file is in the src directory.
